    m_Localized: Check the number of mutants in the node for this stage of the mission.
      If you're ready, let's begin!
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 1087510667264
    m_Localized: Let's learn how to pilot a Raptoroid! First, try dragging left,
      right, up, and down.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 1149460537344

  - m_Id: 1988895956992
    m_Localized: You have defeated your first enemy! Not bad for a rookie! But we

'

      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 3277021241344
    m_Localized: Be careful, however. If your Raptoroid is destroyed before you take
      down the boss mutant, you'll lose a cut from what you've collected.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 3583545171968
    m_Localized: Nicely done! There aren't many who can take down a boss on their
